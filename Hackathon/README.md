Introduction: The objective is to analyse the job requirements behind "data analyst". How do the requirements change across titles and employers?

Data & Methodology: Use topic modeling to render the job requirements from a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/data-analyst-jobs) containing around 2,000 job posts scraped from Glassdoor.
